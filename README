This is short description for using sniffer

Executing:
     sudo ./ipk-sniffer -i <interface_name> [-n <num>] [-u] [-t] [-p <port>]

Parameters:
    -h --help            print info to program
    -i <interfaces_name> interface to be sniffed
    -n <num>             maximum count of packets to be sniffed
    -u --udp             filter UDP packets
    -t --tcp             filter TCP packets
    -p <port>            number of port to be sniffed\n

Example of usage:
    1) make
    2) sudo ./ipk-sniffer -i wlp2s0 
    
    This way of executing would open interface wlp2s0 for sniffing, create 
    default filter for UDP and TCP packets on any port and sniff ona packet. 
    Combination of mentioned parameters would create corresponding filter 
    for sniffing. 

IMPORTANT:
    Program should be executed with root privileges. This is caused by that 
    platform would reject opening interface without root  privileges

Limitations:
    * Can not run without root
    * Program can sniff only TCP and UDP packets
    * There is no ability to set custom port range. Port can be setted by 
      parameter -p, or any port would be used
    * Not testing on IPv6
